# CPP-Modules

C++ was created as an extension of the C programming language to address certain limitations and provide additional features. Here are some problems or limitations that led to the development of C++:

* <u>Lack of Support for Abstraction:</u> C lacked native support for higher-level abstractions, such as classes and objects, which are essential in object-oriented programming. C++ introduced these concepts to facilitate the development of complex software systems.

* <u>Manual Memory Management:</u> In C, programmers have to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation using functions like malloc() and free(). This manual memory management can be error-prone and lead to issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers. C++ introduced automatic memory management through constructors, destructors, and the new and delete operators.

* <u>Lack of Type Safety:</u> C allowed implicit type conversions, which could result in unintended behavior or runtime errors. C++ introduced strong typing and improved type safety, reducing the chances of programming errors.

* <u>Code Reusability:</u> C lacked native support for code reusability beyond functions and libraries. C++ introduced features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling developers to build reusable and modular code structures.

* <u>Lack of Standard Library:</u> C did not have a standardized library with comprehensive support for various functionalities. C++ introduced a rich standard library that provides ready-to-use functions, data structures, and algorithms, reducing the need for developers to write code from scratch.

* <u>Lack of Exception Handling:</u> C had limited support for exception handling, making error handling and recovery more difficult. C++ introduced exceptions as a language feature to simplify error handling and promote robust code design.

* <u>Compatibility with C:</u> C++ was designed to maintain compatibility with C code. Existing C code can be integrated into C++ programs, allowing developers to leverage existing codebases while benefiting from the new features and improvements introduced in C++.

By addressing these limitations and providing additional features, C++ aimed to enhance the programming experience and provide a more powerful and flexible language for software development.
